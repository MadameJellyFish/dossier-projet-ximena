In order to validate the competencies required for the title of Application Designer-Developer, we undertook a project involving different programming languages. This project, completed partly in a group and partly individually, reflects the knowledge and skills acquired during the training.

The Bad's Club, located in Lyon's 7th arrondissement near the Jean MacÃ© metro station, is a sports and lounge space spanning over 1,500mÂ². With 4 badmintons courts, 5 squashs courts, and 4 tables tennis courts, the club offers a wide range of sporting activities for all levels, making it the ideal place for sports sessions, relaxation, or organizing sports tournaments.

Field bookings and customer loyalty are critical to the club's financial success. By offering a simplified booking experience and enabling members to find suitable playing partners to improve their level of play, Bad's Club can stand out from the competition and build strong customer loyalty. Given the collective nature of racket sports, facilitating the search for suitable playing partners is a key factor for the success of this type of establishment.

However, finding a playing partner can sometimes be an obstacle for customers wishing to reserve a court. Therefore, it is crucial to provide a solution that makes it easier for customers to find a playing partner, thereby encouraging regular returns and differentiation from competitors.
By offering a seamless booking experience and helping members find partners that match their skill level, Bad's Club will be well-positioned to stand out in the market. This approach will also foster long-term loyalty among its members.

The application was specifically designed to enhance user experience, simplify the booking process, and create a community of engaged and satisfied players. In addition, it provides robust administrative tools that allow the club's management to efficiently oversee bookings, monitor member activity, and optimize the overall operation of the club.
